The difference between to the two functions becomes apparent as the size of the data structure, the array, increases. Because unshift reqiures changing the location fo subsequent indices as you add the front of the array, the runtime increases more dramatically than adding an index to the end of the array. Unshift is only more effiencent in terms of time if you know the size of the array being used is small.
